# Zeno's WP DevKit
JS + CSS Build Pipeline for Wordpress themes

This is a frontend setup used in static template development such as Wordpress themes or other CMS related templating situations. I use it with Timber 2.0 but you can use the tools you prefer.

The point of this environment is watching and building scripts and styles with a modern approach with ES Modules and PostCSS.


## Basic Structure

Structure the theme as you see fit but keep the structure for these 2 folders:

- assets -> compiled files
  - js -> compiled scripts
  - css -> compiled styles

- dev -> source files
  - js -> source scripts
  - css -> source styles


## Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Change line 162 inside `esbuild.js` to your dev domain


## Commands

`npm run watch` to watch for changes and build assets
`npm run build` to build assets
`npm run bs5` to build Bootstrap from dev/css/bs5/bs5.source (SASS)


## Composer (if using WP + Timber)

1. Run `composer install` to install Timber and other dependencies


## Build notes

- Fonts (woff, woff2, ttf, eot) and other static assets are ignored and not processed during runtime, keep these files and reference them relative to the /assets/ folder


## Notes

- Avoid images in css, there are better ways :P
- The starter comes with some useful JS packages such as gLightbox, Swiper, Plyr, etc.
- Feel free to edit whatever you want as you see fit.
- Other timber files required for the theme such as functions and templates are not included, so you can use this just as a static asset compilation Boilerplate
